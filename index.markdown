I am a former Software Engineer and current Research Engineer. I have worked at large and medium sized companies as an Android Developer such as FanDuel and Snap Inc, as well as small startups and agencies. I am passionate about Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence, and love to work at the intersection of research and engineering.

Currently I am working at [Valeo.AI](https://valeoai.github.io/) as a Research Engineer working on various approaches to End to End driving, with a focus on leveraging simulation to build robust scoring and world models. In addition I work on generative methods for 3D point cloud data in the context of autonomous driving.

## Work Experience

### Valeo AI - Research Engineer

At Valeo AI I am the sole research engineer, wearing many hats and pushing forward our research on autonomous driving. This includes kick-starting our closed loop training pipelines, pushing the development of our open loop approaches, working with researchers to define the future research direction, and opening collaborations with other research teams around the world.

### Zenly - Snap Inc

In 2019 I moved to Paris to learn French, work at Zenly, and eat way too many French pastries. At Zenly I worked on the Conversations team alongside some of the smartest and most hard working people I have met in my life. We built so many creative features our users loved, like the Zenly Voice Notes, dozens of fun chat easter eggs, resizable (giant) text, the camera and Media Request feature (like the inverse of Snapchat). These features were used millons of time everyday and beloved by users. Unfortunately in 2022 Zenly was permanently shut down by Snap.

### DRAFT - FanDuel

I was the solo Android developer on the original DRAFT Fantasy sports app for over two years. We built too many cool features to list and had a great time watching a ton of sports with an awesome team. After our merge into the FanDuel application, I moved to France while the former DRAFT team started a new project, where they are finding a ton of well deserved success, [Underdog Fantasy](https://twitter.com/UnderdogFantasy?s=20).
